1 Customer, 2 User & 2 Sponsor

* Customer: Define the requirement Like (CIO, CEO)
* User: A user who using the service or consuming the service.
* Sponsor: He is the person authorizing the budget of the service Like (CFO) the responsibility of the sponsor is cost saving.

====================================================================================

Service offering: it is an how are you providing service. how your packaging utility and warranty in service offering.
			also, it is the need to design consumer service offerings.

Attribute for Service offering: 
1 Goods:  It is a tangible thing and customers are responsible for future Use.
2 Access to Services:  It is a kind of license with terms and conditions.
3 Service Actions: It is actions to address customer issues, Like Support, incidents & requests.

===================================================================================================
Day #4
What are the four dimensions of service management and SVS (Service Value System)?
Need to understand practices?

The Four Dimensions are People, Process, Technology &  Value streams and processes.

First Dimension: Organization and People: The objective to understand, what are the people skills required & organizational structure required, Organization Structured Required (Cross Functional Teams) What is the RESI Matrix it is a group of people-defined responsibilities. Key Takeaway: (How to form a structure to deliver the customer).

Second Dimension:-Information Technology: There are two parts in this dimension information (Data) & Technology (Controlled, Secure, and Processing Data). whatever technology we need to deliver service that is the objective of information technology. 

How is the information managed, and how is the information being protected?

Two Types of Technology Exist:  1 Service-related Technology Example (Application Server & DB Server and 2 Service Management-Related Technology for example (Customer supporting Tools.) 

Third Dimension: Partner & Supplier: (A partner is someone who work with customers and helps them to achieve their goals.) (however supplier is somebody who supplies only material) (A vendor is someone who gives solutions and supplies the material also.) For Partner and supplier both should have formal Contracts in place)

Fourth Dimension: Value streams and processes: The objective for this dimension is to identify different processes and practices you need to deliver the services.

Values Stream: It has steps or series of activities to convert input to output. example input can be customer requirements.
Customer requirements can be of two types. 1 Customer can take new service requirements and 2 Second Requirement is an enhancement, change request, or add-ons on the existing service.

Output: The service you are providing to the customer to fulfill the customer's requirement. That is called the Value stream (output). The series of activities that provide value is called a value stream.

The first thing is to identify the requirements of the customer and Then find the best practices to achieve the outcome, these are the process to give values stream.

ITIL four has PESTOL Model. 

=====================================================================================
Day #5 ITIL. Service Value System. (SVS)

The SVS describes how all the processes and activities work together as a system to value co-creation. 

When we try to provide value through customer service is called a value system.
A system is a way to provide value through the service, A single cohesive system helps to customer to achieve a business goal.

* Five components work together for a service value system.
1 Guiding principle: As the name suggests that guiding factor, There are 7 guiding principles.
2 Service value chain: It is related to the value stream.
3 Governance: It ensures all the processes policies & principal applies are properly on all value stream activity. 
4 Practices: These are different processes.
5 Continual improvement:  As the name suggests continual improvement.

There is an input to a service value system. it has two components (opportunity and Demand).

7 Guiding principals: 1 Focus on value 2 Start where you are 3 Progress with feedback 4 Collaborate and promote visibility
                       5 Think and work holistically 6 Keep it simple and practical 7 Optimize and Automate.

LEIN: it is reducing waste, and removing non-value activity.
DevOps: It is talk about CI/CD.
Agile: It talks about incremental development.
COBIT: it talks about IT Governance, IT policies, and IT Frameworks.
===============================================================================================
Day #7 (7 Guiding principal)

1 Focus on value: This is the LEIN Principle (Think customer point of View) (Find Risk) you can measure value by SLA's.
Objective: Make customers happy. you need to keep measuring customer experience, taking feedback, Surveys, etc. 

VBF = (Vital business Functions) means the critical function within in customer environment.
CSF = (Critical Success Factors) means that the customer highlighted an issue on you, and he wants to focus on the same.
=======================================================================================================================
2 Start where you are: This means re-utilising existing resources, like people processes & Infrastructure.

"Configuration Item" is a component used to provide service to customers and you can manage that component.

Measurement of Current "CI" Performance and Resources and Plan Accordingly.

===============================================================================================================
3 Progress iteratively with feedback:  The feedback helps to improve in a better way, it allows you to service in a better way. MVB & MMF
Objective: Progress with feedback, make product, and Service becomes more valuable.
====================================================================================================
4 Collaborate and promote visibility: This is an Agile principle, we should take input regularly and encourage collaboration
                                       between the right stakeholders. People should not work independently they should be 
					in sync.

============================================================================================================================
5 Think and work holistically: Means-end-to-end approach, Keep bottleneck approach, keep the end in mind. it will help you find dependencies Risks etc.

=========================================================================================================================
6 Keep it simple and practical: With this LEIN Principle, Simplifying the practices, you have to remove waste, and start with minimum resources.

==========================================================================================================================
7 Optimize and Automate: Optimize and Automate the process to Simplify things, reduce effort, and fast delivery. 
==================================================================================================================
Day #3 Service Relationship: It means the corporation between two organizations the service provider and the service Consumer.
The service relation is important because the single organization can be the service provider and service consumer at the same time.
There are formal contracts and SLA,s are merging two organizations into service relations.

Output: It means tangible and intangible deliverables of an activity are called output or End Result. (SLA Meets)
Outcome: it means the result for stack holders that came from one or more outputs. (Improve Productivity)
Benefits: it came from outcomes. (Improve Business)

Disbenefit: If the outcome does not match the customer's requirements it leads to disbenefits.

Reduction of Cost and Risk: 

Cost: it means money spent on any activity and resource is called cost.

Two Types of Cost are there: 1 Cost imposed on the consumer by service the service and 2 Cost removed from the consumer by the Service.

Risk:  It means possible events that could harm loss and make it more difficult to achieve your objective.

Service Provider: They have to reduce risk and cost from customers.

Risk Can be potentially imposed on the customer by the service.
Risk is also called an uncertain event.

4 Things we can do the risks: 1 Avoid Risk, 2 Accept Risk, 3 Transfer Risk & Mitigate Risk.
=======================================================================================================================
Day #9 Governance & Service Value Chain.

Governance means how to control, directing, and organizing.
Three important activities cover governance: Evaluate, Direct & Monitor.
Everybody should follow a set of policies and procedures as part of governance.

1. Evaluate: You can evaluate customer requirements, You can evaluate organization objectives, You can evaluate previously delivered performance, and You can evaluate which guiding principles need to be adopted.

2. Direct: As part of governance the direction is given to the service value chain (the Service Value chain is a set of activities) We can able to govern through a set of policies and procedures.

3. Monitor: We need to measure the performance of these activities being carried out...


Service Value Chain:  Under the Service value chain we run the value streams which are a set of activities that add value.

The service value chain has multiple activities, Now which are the key activities.  1. Engage, 2. Plan 3. Design 4. Obtain & build 5 Deliver & support  6.Continual improvement. 

1. Engage: Interact with the Customer, establish communication with the customer, and new requirements understood with the customer. Output is customer should be happy and enroll you for services. Output as a LOI (Letter of Intent) you can have contracts.

Day #11  Continual Improvement.

Continual Improvement: iterative model approach, do a gap analysis, by the customer.
Benefit: This approach helps the organization meet organization vision, It should be followed by everyone
CIR (Continual improvement Register): it is a database improvement highlighted. it is a repository for what continual improvement happens. Need to regularly assess for investment etc.
It is the responsibility of the Continual improvement Manager, to make Continual Improvement implemented properly.
===============================================================================================================
Day #12 ITIL Practices.

Practice: People who follow processes are called practices.

ISMS Practices: it ensures this service gets delivered with proper information Security in place. include all service chain activity performed.

Customer data or user data is controlled and secure with no lapses to perform risk management
to find out what information is at risk.

Create information Security Policies for customers, Users & Employees in your organization.
you define information security policies for all these stack holders.
You will define what access controls are there and provisioned. what all access control you put in place what all access control has been granted to stack holders.

Information Security aims to protect the data (information).
Three Critical information security factors are available that is confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
Confidentiality: This means the right person has the right access at the right time.
Integrity: This means that the trueness of your data is supposed to be not tempered.
Availability: this means data is available when a customer wants it. 

Based on the CIA Approach policies should differ as per stack holder.

For example: What access your employee is entirely different, Which access does your vendor that's why CIA is different for different stack holders.

The benefits of implementing this practice, you avoid information security incidents in your organization, you can perform audits in your organization, 
and all configuration items. that is why this information is important.
========================================================================================================================================================
Day #13 Relationship Management Practice.

To establish relationships with your stakeholders at the strategic level and tactical levels.
You need relationship management, this practice bridges customer requirements and needs, customer priority has been identified, BR manager understands customer needs, 
understands the customer wants service from me as the customer, what are the outcomes the customer looking for and already achieved.

The Main objective of Business Relationship management is to understand customers' expectations. both customer priority and satisfaction are taken into consideration.

Any complaints customers have are being looked into.

There are different Roles involved in customer Relationship Management.

Key Account Manager.
Business Relationship Manager.
Relationship Manager.

Most of the time these people on the customer site and being onsite understand the customer requirements, and they understand all unsaid expectations.

They understand requirements within the environment and accordingly, they convey the requirement to the service delivery manager, 
who is responsible for delivering customer requirements. it very important to have this practice.
=======================================================================================================================================
Day #14 Supplier Management Practice.

Supplier is an external organization, with whom we need to work to provide customer services.
The source material came from a supplier.

Objective: To maintain a healthy relationship with all suppliers.

You have strategies, 
What is sourcing strategy,
What needs to outsource, 
What needs to insource, 
How many suppliers do you need, 
What type of supplier do you need, 
How much work should be outsourced, 
Who is the best supplier for you, and why? 
how many categories of suppliers do you have, 

Need to set and Define Policies.
Categorized the supplier. 
You should have a vendor database.
Strategic Supplier.
Tactical Supplier.
Evaluate the Supplier.
You should monitor supplier performance.
Renewal of Contract with supplier.
Supplier performance measurement we should check whether vendors are working as per contract agreement or not. Need to check SLAs and Parameters.

Multiple types of supplier relationships also exist.

In-Sourcing: The company's employees give support same company Users.
Out Sourcing: Outside suppliers give support to your company employees.
Co-Sourcing: Mix of external and internal Resources giving support.
Multi-sourcing: Multiple Vendors working on big contracts for a single customer.
Single/Partnerships sourcing: Two Companies merge and work on a particular project.

Supplier Managers need to keep the Supplier Database with their contracts.
===================================================================================
Day #15 Availability Management Practice.

Availability means up and running.

Should meet the agreed availability of the customer
how to measure the availability, there is a calculation to measure the availability. (Agreed Service Time (-) Minus Downtime (/) Divide by agreed service time x multiply by (100) Hundred.

Agreed Service Time is always measured in percentage (%)

Agreed Service Time : 
Down Time: Planned Downtime, Unplanned Downtime.
Planned downtime is a maintenance activity that is not considered in the availability equation.

Need to identify the critical infrastructure and keep on monitoring these components to provide services on agreed documents.

Availability Management Should work closely with Capacity and performance management.
Identify the Vital Business Component and monitor accordingly.
Availability management ensures the uptime of your services.
There are different ways to achieve availability, Like Technical Aspects, By Implementing Cluster, Raid, and things like that.

The availability report should be assessed, which you have provided to customers.
==============================================================================================
Day #16 Capacity & Performance Management Practice.

Capacity and performance take care of Capacity and performance-related issues, that are happening service value chain.

What is Customer Demand: Customers always have demands in terms of getting services.
Sometimes demand pattern is high, that is called high volume demand.
Sometimes demand is low.

Capacity Assurance means whatever demand you have, it should be fulfilled by capacity and performance management.

To understand and forecast the demands that you are providing, like how many resources you need, and how many supply and capacity are needed to deliver the service and meet to demand.

Activities in capacity and performance management.

Understand the capacity requirements for current and forecasted demands.
We have to design the capacity.
We have to make sure to design the capacity for to appropriate number of people, processes & Technology to meet the demand.
We need to monitor capacity utilization as well.
We need to define ongoing and forecasted demand and accordingly define the amount of supply, which is needed to satisfy the demand.
The Solution Architect and technology should be designed in such a way to fulfill the demand.
We need to Work on CMIS (Configuration management information systems) to meet the demand.
===========================================================================================
Day #17 Change Control Practice.

This is based on controlling the changes and because increased number of successful changes.

Change control only governs the changes by evaluating and monitoring changes.

Make sure risks are identified and authorized to proceed and changes are successful.

We need to validate that the change request has been placed.
We need to make sure there is a valid change request, and accordingly provide approval and rejection.

Also, Post-change needs to verify whether the benefits are working or not.

What can be changed in change control practice: Any modifications are done in the configuration item. Like Addition, Deletion & Upgrade.

Change Authority board helps to approve change.

Three types of changes are pre-approved and authorized.

1. Standard Changes. 
2. Normal Changes.
3. Emergency Changes.

Standard Changes are low-cost and low-risk changes.

Change Control evaluates two types of changes: Normal Changes and Emergency changes.

Normal changes need to be scheduled, Asses, and authorized by the change control process. 
CAB authorizes the changes and approves the changes.

Emergency Change: Any change that needs to be implemented as soon as possible is called emergency change but it should be assessed then it should be implemented.
in this case, approval and authorization should be fast, to implement changes.
You need to call a meeting for emergency changes.

===================================================================================
Day #18 Incident Management Practice.

Several activities have to be performed in incident management.

1. Log the Incident or case.
2. Then you to categorize the incident.
3. Then Prioritize the incident, There is a formula to prioritize the incidents. Impact X Urgency. Measure Incident should be mentioned as an open ticket.
4. High Impact & High Severe incidents are called major tickets, Make sure to open problem tickets and that Major incident tickets are handled by the major incident team, not the service desk team.
5. There are two types of escalations. 1 Functional Escalation 2. Hierarchical Escalation.

A) Functional Escalation: Like escalating to L1, L2 & SME's
B) Hierarchical Escalation: Like Escalating to Sr Manager, VP, & Directors, etc.

6. The Service Desk Team Will be Accountable for escalated issues.
